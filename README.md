## 🚀 Features

### 💬 AI-Powered Chatbot
- Built using **Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)** with LangChain.
- Understands natural language queries for managing subjects & topics.

  - Bulk topic operations (all/multiple subjects)

### 📚 Subject & Topic Management
- Persistent storage in **MongoDB**.
- Supports **subject creation, deletion, and listing**.
- Allows **adding/removing topics** under specific or multiple subjects.

### 📂 File Upload Support
- Upload **CSV files** (automatically parsed into a Pandas DataFrame).
- Upload **PDF files** (text extracted via PyMuPDF).
- Data can be used as **context for chatbot queries**.

### 🗄️ Database Integration
- MongoDB stores all subjects and topics.
- Ensures **no duplicates** with `$addToSet`.
- Supports flexible queries for subject-topic relationships.

### 🧾 Planned DataFrame Agent (WIP)
- Uses `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` to query CSV data with natural language.
- Will allow Q&A over uploaded datasets (future enhancement).
